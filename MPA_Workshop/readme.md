- Need to remove commented, unnecessary code
- App needs to be updated to include:
  - panels/tabs separating the two types of maps that end user can click through.
  - another row showing only census tracts that represent Cortland city, as it is currently hard to see on county-level maps.
  - Dorling Cartogram showing the census tracts as equal sizes, allowing for easier analysis of the data

Application located here:
