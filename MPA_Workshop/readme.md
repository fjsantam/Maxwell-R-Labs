- Need to remove commented, unnecessary code
- App needs to be updated to include:
-- panel separating the two types of maps.
-- another row showing only census tracts that represent Cortland city, as it is currently hard to see on county-level maps.
-- dorling cartogram showing the census tracts as equal sizes, allowing for easier analysis of the data

Application located here:
